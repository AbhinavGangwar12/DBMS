-- generally we perform grouping for aggregation i.e. to find the number of counts for a given dataset 
-- sql provide GROUP BY function to perform such task and it only works with an aggregate function
SELECT DEPARTMENT FROM WORKER GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;-- You should keep in mind that the list provided between SELECT and FROM should be provided after GROUP BY keyword
-- by default GROUP BY is taken as disctinct function in default case when we doesnot provide any aggregate function
-- Aggregate functions -  COUNT,
SELECT DEPARTMENT, COUNT(DEPARTMENT) FROM WORKER GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;
-- Internally, an aggregate function rearranges the table and perform the function after that
SELECT DEPARTMENT, AVG(SALARY) FROM WORKER GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;
SELECT DEPARTMENT, MIN(SALARY) FROM WORKER GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;
SELECT DEPARTMENT, SUM(SALARY) FROM WORKER GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;

-- HAVING keyword is used to filter in GROUP BY(while grouping the elements)
